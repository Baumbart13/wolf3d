 * 2021-04-14:03:00AM::	Found that the BETA-stuff is defined in "WL_DEF.h".. why was it in this file back then? I think
 * 						the reason, why they did it inside of WL_DEF is, that it is the definition-file, where most of
 * 						the definitions for the game itself were defined and they did not want to use too many files AND
 * 						with this, the only had to recompile everything.. literally everything, that had this file
 * 						included. Hmmm.
